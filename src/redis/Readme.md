Copies of this directory **redis** are located in these repos...

* [graphql-redis-github](https://github.com/stormasm/graphql-redis-github)
* [hackernews-favorites](https://github.com/stormasm/hackernews-favorites)

and should be modified accordingly in every repo when a change is made...

The other solution is to publish a set of javascript utilities
including this redis directory
to an NPM repo which is eventually probably what I will end
up doing...
